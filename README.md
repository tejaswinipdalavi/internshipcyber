Over the course of my internship, I worked on a series of practical cybersecurity tasks that helped me turn theoretical knowledge into real-world skills. Each task focused on a key area of cyber defense — from understanding threats to applying tools and best practices.

I started by learning about common cyberattacks and vulnerabilities, including phishing, social engineering, and how exploits are tracked using CVEs. I explored secure login methods by studying and testing multi-factor authentication, which taught me how to strengthen access control.

One of the most eye-opening tasks was using **Wireshark** to capture and analyze live network traffic. I filtered packets by protocol (like DNS, TCP, HTTP) and saw exactly how data flows and where potential risks exist.

I also experimented with password creation and tested their strength using online tools. This helped me understand how attackers use brute-force and dictionary attacks — and why password length, complexity, and uniqueness matter so much.

Through these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with tools, improved my analytical thinking, and developed a stronger cybersecurity mindset. This internship gave me a clearer view of what it takes to protect systems and data in a connected world.
